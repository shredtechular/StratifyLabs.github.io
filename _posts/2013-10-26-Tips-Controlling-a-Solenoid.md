Many products use solenoids to open and close valves. A microcontroller 
can control solenoids programmatically using a GPIO pin and a simple circuit. 

## Circuit

 A solenoid can be enabled using a simple transistor circuit and a microcontroller. 
 The circuit above shows a solenoid, MOSFET transistor, diode, and a microcontroller 
 GPIO signal. To activate the solenoid, the microcontroller GPIO signal goes high 
 causing the MOSFET to turn on. When on, the MOSFET allows current to flow from 
 the power supply through the solenoid and to ground. The voltage rating for the 
 solenoid dictates the voltage of the power supply (it is OK if the power supply 
 voltage is different from the microcontroller voltage). The MOSFET should be 
 selected to handle sufficient current to activate the solenoid as specified in 
 the solenoid's datasheet.

 Because the solenoid is an inductive device, the diode is added to protect the 
 MOSFET. When the solenoid turns off, the current through the solenoid rapidly 
 drops from the nominal value to zero. Since the voltage drop across the solenoid 
 is proportional to the change in current (see equation below), the current drop 
 creates a voltage spike which can damage the MOSFET. The diode prevents the 
 voltage spike from reaching damaging levels by directing the current back to the 
 power supply.

## Firmware Considerations

 Controlling the solenoid in firmware is a straightforward operation with one 
 exception. As mentioned, driving the GPIO high will turn the solenoid on, 
 while driving it low will turn it off. However, there is a small amount of 
 time while the microcontroller starts up where the solenoid may open unexpectedly. 
 For example, if the default GPIO configuration is to have an internal pull-up 
 activated, the solenoid will be activated while the microcontroller is starting 
 up.  To avoid this behavior, an external pull-down resistor can be added to the GPIO 
 line (shown below) to ensure the solenoid stays off during microcontroller 
 initialization.

## Conclusion

Controlling solenoids with microcontrollers is simple. Remember to ensure the MOSFET has sufficient current capability to activate the solenoid, include the protection diode to prevent the solenoid from damaging the MOSFET, and include a pull-down resistor on the GPIO line if the microcontroller doesn't drive the line low at startup.
