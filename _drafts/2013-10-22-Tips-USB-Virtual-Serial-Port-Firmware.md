Desktop communication to embedded devices is critical for programming and 
debugging.  It is also important in production for data acquisition devices 
and other computer peripherals.  Setting up a device as a virtual serial port 
using USB is a great solution for transferring data between desktop computers 
and embedded systems.  It can be connected to most desktop operating systems 
(Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) without installing or developing any USB drivers.

## Introduction to USB

USB is a serial communications protocol that is found in almost all desktop 
computers (its name, Universal Serial Bus, is truly descriptive).  Physically 
USB is just four wires: 5V, ground, data plus and data minus.  It uses 
differential signaling to maximize immunity to noise.  Using differential 
signaling means both data lines are used to send data in one direction making 
USB a half-duplex protocol.  So at any given time, the USB is sending data in 
at most one direction.  The data sent is packetized and error 
checked.  The packets enable communication between logical endpoints stored in the 
host and device.

The basic logical building block of USB is an endpoint.  Unfortunately, 
unlike USB, endpoint is not a descriptive name.  Endpoints are realized 
as memory buffers in the host and device (see above diagram).  In USB, 
the host is always the master, and the slave is the device.  The host 
initiates all communcations.    When the host sends data to a device 
endpoint, it means that the data is packetized, transmitted across the 
data plus and data minus lines, and stored in one of various memory 
buffers (called endpoints) in the device.

USB uses endpoint zero as the control endpoint.  This means all USB devices 
have at least one endpoint.  In order for the host to understand the device, 
it uses the control endpoint to load data that describes the device. This data 
is called a USB descriptor.  The four main types of descriptors are:  

- Device Descriptor:  contains information about the device such as USB version, power consumption, manufacturer and serial number 
- Configuration Descriptor:  contains information about what the device does like mass storage or communications
- Interface Descriptor:  describes one of possibly many ways the host can interact with the configuration
- Endpoint Descriptor:  describes how the host can send data to and get data from an interface

In addition to these descriptor types, different classes define additional 
descriptors that provide additional information about how the device 
works.  For example, a human interface device (HID) has additional descriptors that 
describe the input type (such as mouse, keyboard, joystick, etc).  For a 
virtual serial port, the communications device class (CDC) provides additional 
information about how the host sends information to the device.

## Abstract Control Model

Successfully implementing the abstract control model on the USB device 
requires three things:

### Properly implementing the USB descriptors

1. Responding to interface requests on endpoint zero
1. Reading and writing data on the data class interface
1. USB Virtual Serial Port USB Descriptors

The diagram above (top) outlines the USB descriptors for a CDC device 
using the abstract control model (ACM).  The ACM is used for a virtual 
serial port.  Under the CDC configuration, there are two interfaces:  
the communications class interface and the data class interface.  The 
former is used for control (such as telling the host the status of the 
CTS line has changed) while the latter transfers the serial port data.

### Communications Class Interface

The communications class interface includes four special CDC descriptors:

- CDC Header:  tells the host the size of the special CDC descriptors
- ACM:  tells the host the device is, basically, a virtual serial port
- Union:  tells the host which data class interface to use to transfer data
- Call Management:  tells the host which, if any, commands the device handles over the control endpoint
 
The interrupt endpoint is used when the device needs to send status 
updates to the host.  The endpoint is an in endpoint meaning data is 
sent in to the host from the device.

### Data Class Interface

There are two endpoints that are part of the data class interface. These 
endpoints are effectively used to read and write data over the virtual 
serial port. The bulk in endpoint allows the device to send data to the 
host while the bulk out endpoint transfer data from the host to the device.

### Example Code

The following code is used to set up the endpoint descriptors for the 
virtual serial port.

### Required Interface Requests

The firmware must recognize two special interface requests: 
SEND_ENCAPSULATED_COMMAND and GET_ENCAPSULATED_RESPONSE. The firmware 
must not stall the USB endpoint when these requests arrive. However, 
the firmware does not need to do anything special with the requests 
other than receive them and not stall.

### Reading and Writing Data over the Virtual Serial Port

To send and receive data over the virtual serial port is 
simple. Data is written to the BULK IN endpoint and is read from the BULK OUT 
endpoint. These are the endpoints defined in the data interface.

## Conclusion

The USB communications device class (CDC) abstract control model (ACM) 
is a great way to create a cross-platform software-firmware 
interface. The connection creates a virtual serial communications port that can be 
read and written like a classic serial port but without the outdated cables.
